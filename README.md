# Webapp

<p> Hi, this repository is created for educational purposes.

Contains a list of exercises with increasing difficulty.

In Tutorial 1 and 2, you create a client-server app using UDP and TCP protocols.

In exercise 3 we do the same but with Java language.

In 4 instead, the server logic is separated.

In the following we begin to build a webapp using also the Restful services.</p>
